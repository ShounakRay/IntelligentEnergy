### Stage 1 - Source Table Aggregation
Joining the production, production testing, injection, and fiber data.

### Stage 2 - Physics Feature Engineering
Generating new features based on domain-specific [modified] SAGD knowledge.

### Stage 3 - Anomaly Detection and Aggregation
Using custom anomaly detection package to determine weights.

### Stage 4 - Mathematical Feature Engineering
Generating new features - solely based on combinatorial explosions that are helpful towards model performance.

### Stage 5 - Model Creation and Performance
Running the h2o experiment, assesssing model performance, and picking the best ones.

### Stage 6 - Optimization and Producer Level Steam Allocation
Determinining optimization base table and using domain-specific contraints to tune high-level steam allocation.

### Stage 7 - Injector Level Steam Allocation
The highest resolution of steam allocation.
