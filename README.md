Innovative algorithms which use statistical, AI/ML, and forecasting methodologies to analyze oil-and-gas data

There are two sequential components to this repository. The first step in the pipeline is **Stage 1: Data Ingestion and Pre-Processing* where the client-side data is prepared for **Stage 2: Data Modeling and Prediction**.

## Data Pre-processing
This section will outline the core steps conducted to pre-process the data. The purpose of this step is to ensure clean, restructured, and engineered data which makes sense for predictive modeling algorithms and framework in **Stage 2: Data Modeling**.

## Data Modeling and Prediction
This section will overview the core steps conducted *with* the pre-processed data to develop accurate and robust predictive models. The purpose of this step is to generate even *further* pre-processed data (from a modeling standpoint) and complementary models.
